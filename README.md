# 🌀eunoia ui🌀

This project is a collection of simple ui interactions, done differently in a way that makes you question the default way. 

##  Overview

This is an archive of interaction design experiments, hover states, small transitions, and micro-interactions. It serves as a visual index of creative prototypes, helping me track explorations in motion, feedback, and layout behaviors.

Each interaction links to a deeper breakdown and is filterable by type- interface, content handling, and navigation.
